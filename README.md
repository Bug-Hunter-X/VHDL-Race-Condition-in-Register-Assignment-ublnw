This repository demonstrates a subtle race condition that can occur in VHDL code when assigning signals within a single clock cycle's process. The bug.vhdl file contains the erroneous code, which incorrectly assigns two signals simultaneously within a single rising_edge of the clock. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, particularly with high-frequency clocks. The bugSolution.vhdl file provides the corrected code, which addresses the race condition by using sequential assignments, ensuring that data_out accurately reflects data_in after a clock cycle.
